Implemented the instructions here:

NOTE: I didn't write the gist. I'm just following the instructions...

This has been applied on a brand new rails projects, giving jasmine with coffeescript, with
the coffeescript getting automatically recomipled via Guard.

To setup:

  bundle db:migrate

To run specs you need to start to proceses:
  bundle exec guard
  bundle exec jasmine

Then from a browser go to:
  http://localhost:8888
